Reasoning:
  Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the next immediate action based on the given environment and the robot arms' current 
positions.

  First, I need to visualize the scene. There's a wooden table with a wicker basket in the center-top, a blue tape roll below it, 
and two robot arms-one on each side of the table. Both arms are extended towards the center but haven't made contact yet. The task 
is to figure out what the robots will do next.

  Since both arms are poised above the table but haven't touched anything, the logical next step would be for them to initiate 
movement towards an object. The objects present are the basket and the tape roll. The basket is empty, so maybe the tape roll is the
target? Or perhaps they're going to interact with the basket. But since the tape roll is closer (below the basket), maybe one arm 
will reach down to grab the tape roll. Alternatively, they might both move towards the basket to place something inside. However, 
the basket is empty, so maybe placing the tape roll into it. But the tape roll is stationary, so the arms would need to pick it up. 
Since the arms are mechanical and designed for manipulation, the next action is likely grasping an object. Given that the tape roll 
is directly beneath the basket, maybe the right arm (on the right side) will extend further to grasp the tape roll. Alternatively, 
both arms might coordinate to pick up the tape roll together. But since they're on opposite sides, perhaps one reaches first. The 
most probable next action is one of the arms moving to grasp the blue tape roll.

Assistant:
  One or both robot arms may begin extending toward the blue tape roll or the wicker basket to manipulate or retrieve an object 
from/to them.
